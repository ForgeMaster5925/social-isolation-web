                <p>As an individual, use the solutions given on the previous page to check yourself before you check others. If you as an individual aren't separated from your social life and are somewhat active, then it may be okay to check people around you to see if they are in good health. Checking with friends and family can be helpful for them as everyone needs a little bit of a check up to be okay.</p>

            <div class="changecontent2-p">
                <p>Sometimes problems aren't expressed out loud and they are kept hidden from people. This can have an effect on others who aren't aware of the issue. Checking on people can help give comfort to the person struggling and can let them express their problems. Talking about issues is a great tool rather than keeping it a secret.</p>
