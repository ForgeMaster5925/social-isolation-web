                        <p>Expanding your social group can be a good opportunity to find like-minded people or those who
                            are
                            the
                            polar-opposite. Finding the right crowd of people can also have more opportunities to
                            socialize
                            and
                            bond with other people.

                        <p>Overcoming fears and insecurities is not an easy task, but it's a major benefit. Having fears
                            can
                            hold people back from doing things, especially in social interactions. The best thing to do
                            is
                            to
                            try and gain confidence through attempting to get out of your comfort zone. After a few
                            attempts,
                            look back at your accomplishments and see how it helps you. </p>

                <p>If you feel someone is dealing with isolation, but aren't sure if it's true, consider the following:
                    Are they choosing to be alone do they act happy? Are they in a relationship? Do they talk to people
                    often? Are they bullied? what is their home life? who are they around, and what are they dealing
                    with? These questions can help point out behaviors that may be seen as worrying. Pointing out the
                    main issue and helping someone work through it can save lives.</p>
