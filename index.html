                <h2>What is Isolation/Loneliness?</h2>
                <p>Loneliness is that feeling when you're alone that brings the worst emotions with it. It can bring the
                    worst thoughts in the human mind forward like dwelling on past mistakes, missing people, or choices
                    in life. It makes people think that their current situation is the worst they can be in. Loneliness can ruin
                    moods and kill enthusiasm because of its potent powers to pry people of their happiness and satisfaction. Sometimes it makes the happiest of people question why they feel this way, but it's important to remember that feeling lonely or guilty is a perdectly natural feeling. </p>

                <h2>What to Do About Isolation</h2>
                <p>Isolation, to put it simply, can't be solved with an easy answer. It's a complex issue that can stem
                    from the feeling itself to deeper and more personal issues. Certain internal factors like
                    introversion, social-withdrawal, low self-esteem, or maybe shyness can be the first steps into
                    isolation. Humans were made to be social creatures, so taking away that aspect can affect a person's
                    health. Some solutions to overcoming isolation are overcoming fears, improving conversation skills,
                    or conserving personal energy in social interactions. Sometimes a solution to someone's loneliness is the total opposite of what the problem may be. Wanting to socialize with someone? Go talk to someone. Want to have a friend? Go make one. Now, every social issue isn't as easy to solve and it actually takes a lot of personal effort and courage to keep pushing forward torwards success. </p>
