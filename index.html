            <div class="section1-p">
                <p>Loneliness is that feeling when you're alone that brings the worst emotions with it. It can bring the worst thoughts in the human mind forward like dwelling on past mistakes, missing people, or choices in life. It makes people think that their current situation is the worst they can be in. It ruins moods and kills enthusiasm.</p>

                <h2>What to Do About Isolation</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="section2-p">
                <p>Isolation, to put it simply, can't be solved with an easy answer. It's a complex issue that can stem from the feeling itself to deeper and more personal issues. Certain internal factors like introversion, social-withdrawal, low self-esteem, or maybe shyness can be the first steps into isolation. Humans were made to be social creatures, so taking away that aspect can affect a person's health. Some solutions to overcoming isolation are overcoming fears, improving conversation skills, or conserving personal energy in social interactions.</p>
