                <h2>What is Isolation/Loneliness?</h2>
                <p>Loneliness is that feeling when you're alone that brings the worst emotions with it. It can bring the
                    worst thoughts in the human mind forward like dwelling on past mistakes, missing people, or choices
                    in life. It makes people think that their current situation is the worst they can be in. It ruins
                    moods and kills enthusiasm.</p>

                <h2>What to Do About Isolation</h2>
                <p>Isolation, to put it simply, can't be solved with an easy answer. It's a complex issue that can stem
                    from the feeling itself to deeper and more personal issues. Certain internal factors like
                    introversion, social-withdrawal, low self-esteem, or maybe shyness can be the first steps into
                    isolation. Humans were made to be social creatures, so taking away that aspect can affect a person's
                    health. Some solutions to overcoming isolation are overcoming fears, improving conversation skills,
                    or conserving personal energy in social interactions.</p>
